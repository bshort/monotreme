## FAQ

### Can I use the Free plan in my team?

Of course you can. What else would you use?

### How many devices can the license key be used on?

There's no limit because we don't have licenses.

### Can I get a refund if Monotreme doesn't meet my needs?

Yes, absolutely! You can contact us with `monotrememarks@gmail.com`. I will refund you as soon as possible.

### Is there a Lifetime license?

As software requires someone to maintain it, so we won't sell a lifetime service, since humans are not immortal yet. But if you really want it, please contact us `monotrememarks@gmail.com`.
