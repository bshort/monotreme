## Background

In today's workplace, essential information is often scattered across the cloud in the form of links. We understand the frustration of endlessly searching through emails, messages, and websites just to find the right link. Links are notorious for being unwieldy, complex, and easily lost in the shuffle. Remembering and sharing them can be a challenge.

That's why we developed Monotreme, a solution that transforms these links into easily accessible, discoverable, and shareable shortcuts(e.g., `s/shortcut`). Say goodbye to link chaos and welcome the organizational ease of Monotreme into your daily online workflow.

## Features

- Create customizable `s/` short links for any URL.
- Share short links public or only with your teammates.
- View analytics on link traffic and sources.
- Easy access to your shortcuts with browser extension.
- Share your shortcuts with Collection to anyone, on any browser.
- Open source self-hosted solution.

## Deploy with Docker in seconds
